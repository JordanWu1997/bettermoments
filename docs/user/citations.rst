If you use ``bettermoments`` in your research, please make sure to cite the
RNASS article `Teague & Foreman-Mackey <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/aae265>`_
as,

           author = {{Teague}, Richard and {Foreman-Mackey}, Daniel},
            title = "{A Robust Method to Measure Centroids of Spectral Lines}",
          journal = {Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society},

Additionally, if you make use of the uncertainties for the traditional moment
maps, then citing `Teague (2019) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ab2125>`_
would be appreciated,
